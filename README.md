SmallWorld
==========

Project catalog akin to Squeak Map. The idea is that, with one click, you can load your favorite projects in the best way for that particular image (dialect, version, etc.) in that context (development, deployment, etc.). Right now, it's just a toy I've been using a bit for myself.
